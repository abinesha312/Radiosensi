Predicting Individual Radiosensitivity Using Telomere Length Dynamics and Temporal Attention Networks
Radiation therapy remains a cornerstone of cancer treatment, yet patient-specific responses vary significantly due to biological factors such as telomere length. Current machine learning approaches, including XGBoost and hybrid deep learning models, have demonstrated the potential of telomere length as a biomarker for radiosensitivity prediction. However, these models often overlook temporal patterns in telomere dynamics and lack interpretability for clinical adoption. This project introduces a Temporal Attention Network (TAN)—a lightweight neural architecture that prioritizes critical time-dependent changes in telomere length while maintaining computational simplicity. By focusing on telomere shortening/lengthening rates and integrating explainability tools, TAN achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods, enabling personalized radiotherapy dosing with minimal infrastructure requirements.

Telomere Dynamics as a Predictor of Radiosensitivity
Biological Basis of Telomere-Radiation Interactions
Telomeres, protective nucleoprotein structures at chromosomal termini, influence genomic stability and cellular responses to ionizing radiation. Shorter baseline telomeres correlate with heightened radiosensitivity due to impaired DNA repair mechanisms and increased susceptibility to telomere dysfunction. Post-irradiation, telomeres exhibit dynamic changes: acute shortening at 5 days followed by partial recovery by 10 days, even in telomerase-positive cells. These temporal shifts reflect competing processes of damage accumulation and repair, which vary across individuals due to genetic and environmental factors.

Limitations of Static Telomere Measurements
Traditional models rely on pre- and post-radiotherapy telomere length snapshots, ignoring intermediate dynamics that may better predict long-term outcomes. For instance, rapid telomere shortening within the first 72 hours post-exposure could indicate repair deficiencies, while delayed recovery might signal elevated risks of secondary malignancies. Static measurements also fail to capture intra-patient heterogeneity, as subpopulations of cells with critically short telomeres drive adverse outcomes.

Temporal Attention Network (TAN): Architecture and Workflow
Data Requirements and Preprocessing
Input Features:

Time-series telomere lengths: Measured via Telo-FISH at baseline (pre-treatment), 24h, 72h, and 10 days post-radiation.

Derived temporal features: Rate of change (∆Telomere/day), acceleration (∆²Telomere/day²), and variability (standard deviation across time points).

Patient metadata: Age, cancer stage, and prior treatments.

Normalization:

Z-score normalization per patient to account for baseline length variability.

Model Architecture
TAN combines a 1D convolutional layer for local pattern detection with a transformer-style attention mechanism to weight informative time points:

python
import tensorflow as tf  
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv1D, GlobalAveragePooling1D, Dense, Multiply  
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model  

def TemporalAttention(input_shape):  
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)  
    # Temporal feature extraction  
    x = Conv1D(filters=16, kernel_size=2, activation='relu')(inputs)  
    # Attention mechanism  
    attention = Dense(1, activation='tanh')(x)  
    attention = tf.keras.activations.softmax(attention, axis=1)  
    x = Multiply()([x, attention])  
    x = GlobalAveragePooling1D()(x)  
    outputs = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)  
    return Model(inputs, outputs)  
Key Components:
1D Convolution: Detects local trends (e.g., rapid shortening) within sliding windows of 24–72h.

Attention Layer: Assigns weights to each time point, highlighting critical phases (e.g., day 3 crash).

Global Pooling: Reduces spatial dimensions while preserving temporal features.

Training Protocol
Loss Function: Focal loss to address class imbalance (radiosensitive vs. radioresistant patients).

Optimizer: Nadam with cyclical learning rates (0.001–0.0001).

Regularization: Spatial dropout (30%) and L2 weight decay (λ=0.01).
